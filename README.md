##  H ELLO AND WELCOME TO LAMBDA CALCULUS

This is only lams and apps and variable names and macros

apps are spaces between things
and lams are designated by L and .

grouping is going to be indicated by ( and )

everything besides those are variables!

also files can start with macros which're
``[like=this][and=like this]``
and they're just syntactic sugar for a lambda and app enclosing the main body
